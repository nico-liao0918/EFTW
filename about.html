                    <p>The EFV/T stands for Eco-Friendly Vehicle/Technology.</p>
                    <p>
                        This is the next generation transportation concept that is powered by a 
                        closed-loop, water-based propolsion system. Unlike traditional
                        combustion or electric or hybrid vehicles, the EFV operates independently
                        of any external fuel or charging stations. It is a unique design that 
                        utilizes pressurized water to generate motion and electricity -- all 
                        within a zero-emission, self-sustaining loop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It can be used interchangeably. Using EFV or EFT. Either way is ok.

                        We aim to redifine sustainability in the automotive industry by introducing 
                        a clean, scalable, and innovative approach to vehicle energy. The EFV is 
                        designed to be accessible, practical, and adaptable -- capable of 
                        serving personal cars, buses, trucks, and future utility vehciles with
                        minimal environment impact.

                        We envision the world where vehicles no longer pollute or depend on 
                        limited energy infrastructure. The EFV/T is a step toward that 
                        future -- a future where water, pressure, and innovation work
                        together to create a truly green transportation system.

                        This project began with a question, 
                        "what if there is no need for refueling or charging a vehicle, will 
                        it truly be green solutins?" This question led us to draft a theory 
                        in paper before we have written our first technical paper, our 
                        white paper. This was a culmination of those theory, research, 
                        time, and effort in this EFV. While this is still in the early
                        stages, the vision is intended to challenge current standards and attract
                        potential partnership and cooperation toward innovation and
                        sustainability.
